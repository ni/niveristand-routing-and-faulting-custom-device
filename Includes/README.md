This directory is where external build artifacts should be copied.

Two dependencies are required to build the custom devices:
- `CDMessaging.lvlibp` from [niveristand-custom-device-message-library](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-custom-device-message-library)
- `SLSCSwitchMessaging.lvlibp` from [niveristand-routing-and-faulting-message-library](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-routing-and-faulting-message-library)
